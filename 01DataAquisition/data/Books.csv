Reflecting on Jane Eyre,Pat Macpherson,159,Literary Criticism,"Jane Eyre is a feminist Pilgrim’s Progress in which the heroine asserts the moral equality and responsibility of men and women—an outrageous claim for a female, and moreover a governess, to make. Pat Macpherson reads in Jane Eyre the dramatic dynamic of adolescence itself, as a Gothic landscape of battles and pacts, seductions and betrayals, transgressions and policings, where identity is forged in relation to social norms of class, gender, race, generation, and nationality.
